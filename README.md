## Coripo Generators
Coripo supports generators as a way to create sophisticated and predictable chained events as one event data-wise. Every event can have multiple types of repeats at the same time and multiple sequels. The interesting thing is that sequels can own repeats, too.

## Advanced Event Generator
This is the most customizable event generator for Coripo API, Advanced Event Generator has been developed as a plugin for Coripo API. 

## Notice
This package should be used as a plugin for coripo-api and has no applicability alone on it's own.
